# IntroductionToRobotics
This repository is meant to illustrate my jurney through the "Introduction To Robotics" course taken in my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. In the end, I hope I'll be able to show my progress through my projects and laboratory homeworks, which will include photos, code and documentation.
